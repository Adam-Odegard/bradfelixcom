					        <div id="tab1"><p>While on a Missionary, Pam had contracted a pathological ameoba infection (dysentary).  It wasn't until she slipped into a coma and received medical attention, that she found out she was pregnant.  Many doctor's recommended Pam to have an abortion because of the medications she had received to bring her back from the coma and get rid of the infection.  The doctors said the medications would cause unrecoverable damage to the baby.  Being a very religous family, Bob and Pam chose to not have an abortion.  Pam's doctors had expected a still born birth.  Timothy Richard Tebow was born on August 14th, 1987 in the Phillippines. Tim was the 5th child born to Bob and Pam Tebow.</p>
					        <p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2739/4458854846_b52ff9bd6e_o.jpg" style="float:left; margin:10px; border:1px solid #000;" />All of the Tebow children were home schooled by Pam.  This allowed her to raise her children with christian values and beliefs.  In 1996, a piece of legislation passed through the florida government allowing home schooled children to participate in local high school sports.  The law specified that those homeschooled students that wanted to participate may do so on the team of the local school district.  At this time, the Tebows lived in Jacksonville, Florida, where Tim plated linebacker and tight end for Trinity Christian Academy.  Tim preferred to play quarterback, but Trinity Christian did not rely on a passing attack.  Tim decided to search elsewhere for a school more suited to his style of play.  Tim decided on Nease High School, but since he did not live in that school district, Pam and Tim moved into an apartment within the school district so he could play on the team.  Shortly after joining the team, he success and performance was turning heads and soon lead to a controversy about home schooled students having their choice of which school to play for.</p>
					        <p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2536/4458854822_9f9f600320_o.jpg" style="float:right; margin:10px; border:1px solid #000;" />During Tim junior year in high school he soon became a top quarterback prospect for major college football programs and would eventaully be named Florida Player of the Year.  In his Senior year, Tim would repeat as Florida's Player of the Year.  He also earned All-State honors, he was named Florida's Mr. Football and named to be a Parade All-American.  His biggest highlight of the year was when he finished a game with a broken leg.  Tim finished his high school career with 9,810 passing yards, 3,186 rushing yards, 95 passing touchdowns and 62 rushing touchdowns.</p>
					        <p>Tim was considered to be one of the best recruits and was featured in several ona-ir and magazine publications, including ESPN's "Faces in Sports" and Sports Illustrated's "Faces in the Crowd".  He was named to Florida High School Athletic Associations All-Century Team(FHSAA), that lists the Top 33 players in the states 100 year history of high school football.</p>
					        <p>Tim finally decided to attend the <a href="http://www.uf.edu">University of Florida</a>  because of Urban Meyer's  spread offense, which gave him the best chance of success as he was cnosidered an archetypal quarterback for that system.</p>
					        </div>
					        <div id="tab2"><p>Tim debuted for Florida at the annual "Orange &amp; Blue" spring game.  He completed 15 of 21 passes for 197 yards and 1 touchdown.  Despite speculation, Urban Meyer stuck with Chris Leak as the starting quarterback for the year.  Prior to 2006, Tim was listed by S.I. as college footablls future top mobile quarterback.</p>
					        <p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2793/4458075351_a2c983ca26_o.jpg" style="float:left; margin:10px; border:1px solid #000;"/>Tim made his collegiate debut on Saturday, September 2nd against Southern Miss.  Tim came off the bench in a goal line situation and rushed for his first touchdown.  It was a designed quarterback sneak and thus started the 2 quarterback option at the University of Florida.  The following week against the University of Central Florida, Tim led the team in rushing yards with 63 and a long of 29.</p><p>On September 16th, Tim made his Southeastern Conference (SEC) debut against hated rival, The University of Tennessee Volunteers.  Tim rushed for 29 totals yards, but converted a crucial fourth down that eventually led to the game winning touchdown.  </p>
					        <p>Tim's biggest game of the season was on October 7th, in "The Swamp" for Homecoming.  Tim was credited for all 3 of the Gators touchdowns.  Tim threw for 2 touchdowns and passed for 40 yards and rushed for 1 touchdown.  His first passing touchdown came in this game and was a 1 yard "jump pass" to Tate Casey.</p>
					        <p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4064/4458075389_d71f7c3c4e_o.jpg" style="float:right; margin:10px; border:1px solid #000;"/>On January 8th, in the BCS National Championship game in Glendale, Arizona, Tim threw for 1 touchdown and rushed for another.  Securing the Gator's 2nd National Championship ever.  The Florida Gators won the game 41-14 over the hugely favored Ohio State Buckeyes.  </p>
					        <p>Tim finshed the year with 469 rushing yards and 8 touchdowns.  358 passing yards and 5 touchdowns.  He totaled 827 total yards and averaged 59.1 yards per game.</p></div>
					        <div id="tab3"><p>Starting the 2007 season, Tim Tebow was named one the "Breakout Players of 2007".  He was also named the starter for the defending National Champs.  This was the season that the offense was expected to be much like that of what Urban Meyer had constructed at Utah a few years prior.</p>
					        <p>There were many critics about Tim as a full time passer.  He silienced his critics by opening the year with 300 yards passing and 3 touchdowns against Western Kentucky University.  In the Gator's week 4 match-up against SEC opponent Ole' Miss, Tim broke the school record for rushing yards by a quarterback in 1 game with 166.</p>
					        <p>On Novermber 3rd, against SEC ooponent Vanderbilt, Tim rushed for 2 touchdowns to break the all time SEC quarterback touchdown record in a single season.  Against LSU, Tim was unable to lead a scoring drive and LSU cameback to win the game and would go on to become the National Champs, handing the Gator's 1 of their 3 losses on the season.</p>
					        <p>On November 10, against SEC opponent South Carolina, Tim broke a school record for rushing touchdowns (19 at this point) and set a career high 5 touchdowns in one game.  With his 19 touchdowns, this tied him for an SEC record (with 3 other players, Shain Alexander, Garrison Heart and LaBrandon Toefield).  He also broke a school record for touchdowns accounted for in a single season with 42.</p>
					        <p>On November 17, Tim set a news SEC records for 20 rushing touchdowns in a single season and became the only player ever to rush for 20 touchdowns and throw for 20 touchdowns in a single season.</p>
					        
					        <p>After the regular season was over, Tim was an immediate favorite for the Heisman Trophy, which is given to the most outstanding college player of the year.  Which he would later win and would become the first sophomore ever to win the award.  He later went on to win the Davey O'Brien award, which is given to the best quarterback.</p>
					        <p>After such an amazing season for Tim and only a mediorce season for the Gators (10-2), they would face Big-10 opponent Michigan in the Capital One Bowl.  The Gator's would lose this game, 410-25, but Tim maintained his record for at least 1 rushing and passing touchdowns in a game.  Tim also raised his record of total tuchdowns in a season for 55.  It is noteworthy as Tim played this game with a cast on.</p>

							<div id="tab4"><p>Before the 2008 season, Urban Meyer always said that he would use a 2 quarterback system to take the load off of Tim's shoulders.  However, Tim was the starter and remained the starter for every game in the season.  At the begin of the year, hopes were high for another national championship.  The Gators had the telnt to do so, new runnigs backs, an experienced defense and Tim Tebow, how could any forget Tim Tebow.</p>
							
							<p>Tim and the Gator's started the season very strong.  Posting 56-10, 26-3 and 30-6 against University of Hawaii, University of Miami(FL) and those hated Tennessee Volutenteers.  Then it happened, on September 27th,in what I would considered the most defining moment in college football history, after a 31-30 loss to Ole' Miss... in "The Swamp".  Tim had this to say...

							  It was from that point on that the Gators simply demolished which ever team opposed them on saturday.  Perhaps their most lop sided win on the season came on October 25, at the Homecoming game against the Kentucky Wildcats.  The Gators put up a lot of points, jumping out to a 49 - 3 lead after the 1st quarter.</p><div style="margin-left:0px; float:left;"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2801/4458075455_4557be9e75_o.jpg" height="241" width="420" style="border:1px solid #000;"/></div>
							  
							<p>
								Tim's biggest test as a quarterback game in the SEC Championship Game against SEC Opponent Alabama.  The game was grid locked most of the game until alabama scored late in the 3rd quarter, to take the lead.  This as everyone had come to know was "Tebow Time", only this time is was different.  He seemed to pick up and carry the will of the defense and offense in the 4th quarter.  It was almost as if he rendered the opposing team helpless.  Tim lead two scoring drives late in the fourth quarter to seal the deal for florida.  The ended the undefeated streak of alabama and would hopefully get to play in the national championship game.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the week's leading up to the BCS selection show, there had been quite an amount of talk about whether Florida deserved to be in the Big Game if they made it that far because Texas and Oklahoma were so good.  Well, the time had come and Florida was selected to play in the BCS National Championship Game, and they would be facing the Oklahoma Sooner.  This proved to be a monster match up for both team's, as they were really the best two teams in the nation.  Tim lead the Gators to score on their 1st drive of the second quarter, with a 20 yard passing touchdown to Louis Murphy.  This gave Florida the lead 7 - 0.  Oklahoma would score to even up the game.  They went into half time tied up.  Then Tim lead the Gators on a 13 play 75 yards drive eating 5 minutes and 22 seconds of the clock to again take the lead in the 3rd quarter.  Tim would go on to lead 2 more scoring drives in the 4th quarter to give the Gators the win and their 3rd ever National Championship.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								It was just a few days later at a pep rally for the team to celebrate their National Championship.  Anxiety was running high in Gainesville as know wanted to see their Superhero leave Florida.  Tim had not told anyone his decision to stay at Florida or go Pro.  He made his desicion on this day, He's staying for 1 more year at The University of Florida!

							<div id="tab5"><p>The 2009 season was supposed to be a repeat year for the Gators as their entire starting Defense had returned as well as most of their starters on offense.  For Tim, this was supposed to be year in which he would likely wrap up his 2nd Heisman Award.  The Gators opened the season absolutely on fire and looked like a formidable foe for anyone.  Tim had thrown for and rushed for a touchdown in every regular season game since he was the starter.  That streak came in an end against a touch Tennessee Volunteer team.  Tim did rush for a touchdown but was unable to toss one.  The wide receiving core obviously missed Percy Harvin as defenses did not have to worry about him, which left more defenders to drop back in pass coverage.</p>
							<p>
								Despite the lack a homerun talent, Tim continued to lead the Gators to win after win.  In perhaps the scariest moment, I have ever had to stand in a stadium and watch came in a game against the Kentucky Wildcats.  It was an evening game televised on ESPN and Tim had lead the Gators to a big lead going into half time.  It was in the 3rd quarter, on a play perhaps Tim should have been sitting on the bench, the Gators were in the redzone looking to score again.  When Tim dropped back and was sacked by a linebacker whom had gotten through the line and Tim did not see him until last second right at impact.  Tim was taken off his feet and driven into the ground, where he lay motionless for 1,2,3,5,10,15 minutes...  GatorNation, myself include, held our collective breath.  While I was standing there in the crowd with all my Gator fans, I wanted to cry.  Tim had not moved for almost 20 minutes now.  The training staff was at his side VERY quickly.  Upon watching the replay, you could see Tim's head snap forward on the knee of one of his Offensive linemen.  All the Gator fans in attendance, starting chantting, "Get Up Tebow"...  Tim eventually stood up to a huge roar and walked off to the sidelines where he sat on the bench.  He was eventually carted off the field and taken to the hospital.  Tim was diagnosed with a concussion and playing status for any future games was uncertain.

							<p>
								The Gators had a bye week the following week and rumors of Tim practice spread through GatorNation like a wildfire.  The pregame before the LSU match 2 weeks later was all about whether Tim would play.  To the joy of Gator Fans everywhere, Tim did play, but was limited in the amount of carries he got.  Personally, I feel Tim was not quite the same for many weeks.
							</p>
							<p>
								On October 31, against the Georgia Bulldogs, Tim ran for his 50th and 51st rushing touchdowns of his career.  This broke the previous SEC record held by Herschel Walker.  Tim's final game at the swamp was memoriable as everyone in the stands, chanted "Thank You Tebow".
							</p>
							<p>
								The 2009 SEC Championship, once again pitted Florida vs. Alabama.  This time, both teams were sporting impressive undefeated marks at 11 - 0.  The Gators as a whole looked flat and not well prepared for Alabama and the game ended with a crushing loss, and saw Tim crying on the sidelines.  Many people mocked and called him all kinds of names.  I felt the complete opposite and sat at home on my couch and cried with him.  It was upsetting because of all the hard work and the extreme passion that Tim put into the football program, to have it all come crashing down.  It was the first time in school history that the Gators had gone undefeated in regular season play and GatorNation felt the SEC Championship was just another hurdle in gaining another Championship.   
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Tim Tebow had just one more game to play as a Florida Gator and the opponent was the University of Cincinnati.  Now me personally, I had to listen to weeks of "Florida will never win" sentiments from everyone I know in cincinnati.  I just shrugged it off and always replyed "We'll see!"  Finally the time had come and the Sugar Bowl was on.  Tim lead a very impressive attack against a highly overrated opponent.  Quickly running up the score to 30-3 at half.  Tim would lead the Gators to a 51-24 victory.  Tim finished his career as a Florida Gator by setting two BCS Records.  He threw for 482 yards (career high) and gathered up a total of 533 yards. Tim Tebow will always be remembered by GatorNation as a man who gave is all for his team and wore his emotions on his sleeves.  Tim Tebow is the Greatest Florida Gator of all time and perhaps the Greatest Player in College Football History.  Tim finished his college career with 9285 passing yards with 88 touchdowns and 2947 rushing yards with 57 touchdowns. Tim Tebow walked off the field for the last time as a Florida Gator with 3:20 left on the clock in the 4th Quarter.  As GatorNation everyone chanted... "Tebow, Tebow, Tebow, Tebow, Tebow..."
